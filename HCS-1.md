### HCS-1 Standard: Image Data Management with Hedera Consensus Service

The HCS-1 standard provides a systematic approach to encode, chunk, upload, retrieve, and reassemble image data for applications using Hedera Consensus Service (HCS). This process is agnostic of the implementation details, focusing on the JSON structure and the use of a registry for efficient data management.

#### Encoding and Chunking

Before uploading to HCS, image data is encoded in base64 format and chunked into segments smaller than 1KB. Each chunk is encapsulated in a JSON object with two attributes:

- `o`: The order index indicating the chunk's sequence in the overall image.
- `c`: The chunk's content, a substring of the base64-encoded image.

```json
{
  "o": 0,
  "c": "base64-encoded-chunk"
}
```

#### Uploading to HCS

Chunks are uploaded to a Hedera Consensus Service topic as HCS messages.

#### Registry Use

A registry is employed to track uploaded data and their corresponding topic IDs on HCS. When data is uploaded, a registry entry can be created with the following structure to get qn inscription # assigned:

```json
{
  "p": "hcs-1",
  "op": "deploy",
  "t_id": "topicId",
  "to": "walletAccountId"
}
```

- `p`: Protocol number
- `op`: The operation type, here "deploy" indicates registering a new upload.
- `t_id`: The topic ID where the image chunks are uploaded.
- `to`: The wallet account ID associated with the upload.

This entry is submitted to a predefined registry topic on Hedera, facilitating easy discovery and reference of uploaded images.

#### Retrieving and Reassembling

To display the data, the application retrieves all chunk messages from the specified HCS topic. Chunks are sorted by their order index (`o`) and concatenated based on their content (`c`). The combined base64 string is then decoded back into binary image data for display.

#### Conclusion

The HCS-1 standard outlines a robust protocol for managing large image data sets within the Hedera Consensus Service, leveraging JSON for data structuring and a registry for efficient topic management. This approach ensures data integrity, facilitates easy data retrieval, and supports scalable application development on Hedera.
